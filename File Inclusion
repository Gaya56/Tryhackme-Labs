What is File inclusion? 
File inclusion happens when a Web application allows users to request files using parameters in the URL.
EX) a website might let ou view an image or read a text file by adding a specific parameter to the URL. - if these parameters can be manipulated to access files you should not have access too. 

The Three main types are... 
1. Local File Inclusion: this vulnerability allows an attacker to incluse files on the server, often leading to exposure of sensitive information like configuration files or passwords 
2. Remote File Inclusion: This vulnerability allows an attacker to include files from an external source, which can lead to remote code execution and full control over the server. 
3. Directory Traversal: This attack involves manipulating file paths to access files outside the intended directory, potentially exposing critical system files. 

EX) 
http://Webapp.thm/get.php?file=userCV.pdf 

"http"       = Protocol 
"webapp.thm" = Domain Name 
"get.php"    = File Name 
"?"          = Query string Begin 

/*Imagine a user wants to view their CV on a website. 
They send a request to the web server with the file they want to see. 
For example, the request might look like this: http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=userCV.pdf. In this URL, "file" is the parameter, 
and "userCV.pdf" is the specific file the user wants to access.*/

Why do they happen / what is the risk? 
File inclusion vulnerabilities occur when web applications, often written in languages like PHP, don't properly validate user input. This allows attackers to manipulate input and access unintended files. 
The main risk is that attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to leak sensitive data or, in more severe cases, execute remote commands on the server if they can upload files.
