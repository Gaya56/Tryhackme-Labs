## Content Discovery Lab Summary

This document provides a simplified summary of the content discovery lab from TryHackMe, explaining key concepts, methods, and steps involved. The summary is structured with short notes around the codes for better understanding.

## What is Content Discovery?
Content discovery in web application security involves finding hidden or private content on a web server that isn't immediately visible. This content could include staff portals, backup files, configuration files, administration panels, etc.

### Methods of Content Discovery:
1. **Manual Methods**
   - Manually checking various places on a website to uncover hidden content.
2. **Automated Methods**
   - Using tools to automate the process of discovering hidden content.
3. **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**
   - Using open-source intelligence tools and techniques to gather information.

## Steps in the Lab

### Task 1: Understanding Content Discovery
**Manual Methods, Automation Methods, OSINT**

**Explanation:**
- **Manual Methods:** Techniques like examining source code, URL parameters, and guessing hidden paths.
- **Automation Methods:** Using tools to systematically discover content by trying many different URLs and file names.
- **OSINT:** Gathering information from publicly available sources like search engines and social media.

**Questions:**
1. Manual Methods (Answer: Manual Methods)
2. Automation Methods (Answer: Automation Methods)
3. OSINT (Answer: OSINT)

### Task 2: Robots.txt
- The `robots.txt` file tells search engines which pages to show or hide. This file can give clues about hidden areas of a website.

**Explanation:**
- Robots.txt is often used to prevent search engines from indexing certain parts of a site, but it can reveal sensitive directories if misconfigured.

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://MACHINE_IP/robots.txt
```
**Question:**
- What is the directory in the robots.txt that isn't allowed to be viewed by web crawlers? (Answer: /staff-portal)

### Task 3: Favicon
- Favicons can provide clues about the framework used to build a website.

**Explanation:**
- A favicon is a small icon associated with a website. Sometimes, default favicons from frameworks are not changed, revealing the framework used.

**Command to find favicon hash:**
```sh
curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
```
**Question:**
- What framework did the favicon belong to? (Answer: CGI:IRC)

### Task 4: Sitemap.xml
- The `sitemap.xml` file lists all the files the website owner wants to be listed on search engines. It can reveal difficult-to-navigate areas.

**Explanation:**
- Sitemap.xml is intended to help search engines index the site but can reveal all URLs intended to be indexed, including some that may not be accessible through the UI.

**Command:**
```sh
curl http://MACHINE_IP/sitemap.xml
```
**Question:**
- What is the path of the secret area that can be found in the sitemap.xml file? (Answer: /secret-area)

### Task 5: HTTP Headers
- HTTP headers can provide information about the web server software and scripting languages used.

**Explanation:**
- HTTP headers are part of the server's response to requests. They can contain information about the server's software, which might be useful for identifying vulnerabilities.

**Command:**
```sh
curl -v http://MACHINE_IP
```
**Question:**
- What is the flag value from the X-FLAG header? (Answer: FLAG_VALUE)

### Task 6: Framework Stack
- By examining the page source, you can find clues about the framework used and its documentation.

**Explanation:**
- Sometimes, developers leave comments or metadata in the HTML that can reveal what software or frameworks are being used.

**URL:**
```sh
http://MACHINE_IP
```
**Question:**
- What is the flag from the framework's administration portal? (Answer: FLAG_VALUE)

### OSINT Methods

#### Google Hacking/Dorking
- Utilize Google's advanced search features to find specific content on a website.

**Explanation:**
- Google Dorking uses advanced search operators to find specific information on websites. This can reveal sensitive information unintentionally exposed.

**Example:**
```sh
site:tryhackme.com admin
```
**Question:**
- What Google dork operator can be used to only show results from a particular site? (Answer: site)

#### Wappalyzer
- An online tool and browser extension that identifies technologies used by a website.

**Explanation:**
- Wappalyzer can detect what technologies and frameworks are being used on a website by analyzing the site’s HTML and JavaScript.

**Question:**
- What online tool can be used to identify what technologies a website is running? (Answer: Wappalyzer)

#### Wayback Machine
- A historical archive of websites that shows how they looked in the past.

**Explanation:**
- The Wayback Machine archives versions of web pages over time, which can help find outdated content or configurations that may still be accessible.

**Question:**
- What is the website address for the Wayback Machine? (Answer: https://archive.org/web/)

#### GitHub
- Search GitHub for repositories related to the target website for potential sensitive information.

**Explanation:**
- GitHub hosts public and private code repositories. Searching for a target’s repositories can reveal sensitive information like source code and configuration files.

**Question:**
- What is Git? (Answer: A version control system)

#### S3 Buckets
- Amazon S3 buckets can sometimes have misconfigured permissions, making them accessible publicly.

**Explanation:**
- S3 buckets are used to store data in the cloud. If misconfigured, they can be publicly accessible, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Question:**
- What URL format do Amazon S3 buckets end in? (Answer: .s3.amazonaws.com)

### Task 12: Automated Discovery
- Using tools like ffuf, dirb, and gobuster to automate content discovery.

**Explanation:**
- Automated tools use wordlists to try many different URLs and file names quickly, identifying which ones exist on the target server.

**Commands:**
```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ
dirb http://MACHINE_IP/ /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
gobuster dir --url http://MACHINE_IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the directory beginning with /mo... that was discovered? (Answer: /monitor)
2. What is the name of the log file that was discovered? (Answer: development.log)
